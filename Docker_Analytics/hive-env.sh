# Set Hive and Hadoop environment variables here. These variables can be used
# to control the execution of Hive. It should be used by admins to configure
# the Hive installation (so that users do not have to set environment variables
# or set command line parameters to get correct behavior).
#
# The hive service being invoked (CLI etc.) is available via the environment
# variable SERVICE

# The heap size of the jvm stared by hive shell script can be controlled via:
#
export HADOOP_HEAPSIZE=2048
#
# Larger heap size may be required when running queries over large number of files or partitions. 
# By default hive shell scripts use a heap size of 256 (MB).  Larger heap size would also be 
# appropriate for hive server.
